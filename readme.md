# Basic paper wallet generator for Tezos

Funded and hosted by benevolent capitalist and philosopher Jarrod Woodard @ volxtz.com

Still needs some formatting work to fit three to a page.

Pretty basic little application thrown together in a little over a day's work.

Recently updated to use the same library the [Kukai
wallet](https://wallet.kukai.app/) for generating the wallets. It still uses
the legacy style wallet. So be sure to select that when you import.
